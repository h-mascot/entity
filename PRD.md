# Pandora - The AI Operating System

**An AI OS where agents work, humans watch, and everyone collaborates.**

---

## Vision

Pandora is a fully contained AI operating system. Your agents live here. They write, research, build, browse, and communicate - all in one place. You can enter watch mode and follow their work in real time, or jump in and collaborate naturally.

No more scattered tools. No more invisible agents. One workspace. Everything visible.

- [ ] **Message search** - Search across all channels from Pandora
- [ ] **Voice messages** - Play and send voice from the workspace

### Phase 5: TUI Terminal
**Status:** Planned

A terminal pane for power users. Run commands, see agent output, interact with the system.

- [ ] **Embedded terminal** - xterm.js terminal pane
- [ ] **Agent terminal sessions** - Watch agents run commands
- [ ] **Split terminal** - Multiple terminal panes
- [ ] **Command palette** - Quick access to any Pandora action
- [ ] **Script runner** - Execute scripts from the file browser

### Phase 6: Full AI City
**Status:** Vision

The spatial interface. Zoom into any agent, any project, any moment.

- [ ] **Spatial workspace** - 2D/3D view of your agent fleet
- [ ] **Agent neighborhoods** - Clusters of agents on the same project
- [ ] **Project rooms** - Dedicated spaces for each project
- [ ] **Live dashboards** - Real-time metrics, progress, cost tracking
- [ ] **Agent marketplace** - Add new agents to your city
- [ ] **Multi-user** - Multiple humans in the same workspace
- [ ] **Mobile-first city view** - Pan/zoom on phone to explore

---

### Phase 7: Universal Search (ChromaDB)
**Status:** Planned

Natural language search across everything in Entity — tasks, docs, chats, agent activity. Ask "what did we work on last week?" and get a real answer.

**Why ChromaDB:**
- In-process (embeds alongside SQLite, zero new infra)
- Auto-embeds text (no manual embedding pipeline)
- Node.js client, fits our stack
- Perfect for our scale (thousands of items, not billions)

**Core Features:**
- [ ] **Unified search bar** - Natural language queries across all Entity modules
- [ ] **Auto-indexing** - Every task, doc, chat message, and agent activity auto-embedded on create/update
- [ ] **Cross-module results** - Single query returns tasks + docs + chats ranked by relevance
- [ ] **Time-aware queries** - "last week", "yesterday", "this month" resolved contextually
- [ ] **LLM-powered answers** - Feed search results as context to LLM for conversational responses ("You focused on X, Y, Z last week")
- [ ] **Agent activity search** - Find what any agent worked on, when, and what they produced
- [ ] **Incremental sync** - Only re-embed changed/new items (not full reindex)
- [ ] **Search API** - `GET /api/search?q=...` endpoint for agents and UI

**Architecture:**
```
User query → ChromaDB similarity search → Top-K results
                                              ↓
                                     LLM context window
                                              ↓
                                     Conversational answer
```

**Data Sources Indexed:**
| Source | Embedded Fields | Update Trigger |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| Tasks | title + description + notes | on create/update |
| Docs | full markdown content | on save |
| Chat messages | message text + sender | on receive |
| Agent activity | action + output summary | on activity log |

**Tech:**
- ChromaDB (in-process, persistent storage in `packages/db/`)
- OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` (cheap, fast, good enough)
- Runs as a service alongside Express server
- ~50ms query latency for 10K+ items

## Advanced Phases

### Advanced Phase 1: RoboClaw Integration
**Status:** Vision | **Repo:** https://github.com/hintjen/RoboClaw

RoboClaw is an agent provisioning layer. It sets up OpenClaw gateways and powers Entity instances automatically. One command spins up a full agent workspace.

**The flow:**
```
RoboClaw → provisions OpenClaw Gateway → powers Entity instance
         → configures agents, skills, memory
         → connects to user's data sources
         → Entity is ready to use
```

- [ ] **RoboClaw CLI integration** - `roboclaw init` creates a full Pandora instance
- [ ] **Gateway provisioning** - Auto-configure OpenClaw with agents, models, skills
- [ ] **Entity auto-deploy** - Spin up Entity frontend connected to the new gateway
- [ ] **Agent templates** - Pre-configured agent crews (research team, dev team, sales team)
- [ ] **Data source connection** - Auto-connect Google Workspace, Slack, GitHub on init
- [ ] **One-click setup** - From zero to working AI workspace in minutes

### Advanced Phase 2: Multi-Tenant
**Status:** Vision

Multiple users, multiple organizations, shared infrastructure.

- [ ] **Tenant isolation** - Each org gets their own agent fleet and workspace
- [ ] **User management** - Invite team members, assign roles
- [ ] **Shared agents** - Agents that serve multiple users in the same org
- [ ] **Usage metering** - Track tokens, API calls, storage per tenant
- [ ] **Admin dashboard** - Org-level view of all agents, users, activity
- [ ] **SSO / OAuth** - Enterprise auth integration

### Advanced Phase 3: Marketplace & Ecosystem
**Status:** Vision

An ecosystem where anyone can build on Pandora.

- [ ] **Skill marketplace** - Install agent skills from a marketplace
- [ ] **Agent marketplace** - Pre-built agents for specific workflows
- [ ] **Plugin system** - Third-party panels (analytics, CRM, custom tools)
- [ ] **API** - Public API for building on top of Pandora
- [ ] **White-label** - Rebrand Pandora for enterprise customers

## Core Concepts

### Watch Mode
Enter watch mode and just follow your AI working. See their cursor move, files open, content appear. Like watching someone code over their shoulder, but it's your agent fleet building your business while you watch.

### Interact Mode
Jump in anytime. Edit the same document. Drop an @mention. Start a conversation in context. Your agents respond in real time, in the document, in the workspace.

### Sheets Integration
Load your Google Sheets. Watch agents populate data, update cells, run calculations. See your pipeline fill up in real time.

### Fully Contained
Everything happens inside Pandora. No switching between Telegram, Chrome, VS Code, Obsidian, and terminal. One interface. All your agents. All your files. All your communication.

## Why "Pandora"

Pandora opened a box and released everything into the world. This is the box where AI agents live and work. Open it, and you see everything they're doing. Every file. Every thought. Every action.

The name captures both the power and the responsibility. You're opening a window into artificial minds at work.
